## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Next.js over Vue 3: User preference, better Vercel integration
- No database: Keep it simple, data is static defaults
- Full rewrite over migration: Old codebase has tech debt, clean start is faster
- New UI design: Old Element UI look is dated, fresh start

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tailwind CSS v4 has breaking changes from v3 — verify shadcn/ui compatibility at project init before starting Phase 2
- Algorithm specification needs edge cases written as test cases before implementation in Phase 3 (minimum pool size, impossible budget behavior)
